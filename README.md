Welcome to my 15 Smart Contracts series – a hands-on journey into Ethereum blockchain development using Solidity. This repository showcases a curated set of smart contracts that I’ve built to explore core concepts, token standards, and real-world use cases.
🚀 Projects Overview
Throughout this series, I’ve developed contracts covering:
ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155 token standards
NFT marketplaces and minting platforms
Fundraising & crowdfunding mechanisms
Lotteries, voting systems, and other decentralized applications

Each project demonstrates:

Solidity best practices

Smart contract deployment and testing with Hardhat

Real-world blockchain application logic

💡 Learning Goals

This series is designed to:

Strengthen understanding of Ethereum smart contracts

Explore token standards and their applications

Gain hands-on experience with testing and deployment

Prepare for real-world blockchain and Web3 development
